# RedditTool
Tool to show top posts from reddit

 - The program makes a request to reddit.com/top.json, receives a JSON with top po and processes it
 - Implemented pagination logic, landscape orientation
 - If the post has a picture, it can be viewed in full size and downloaded to device (by clicking on it)
