# RedditTool
Tool to show top posts from reddit

The program makes a request to reddit.com/top.json, receives a JSON with top po and processes it
Implemented pagination logic, but better option would be using kotlin + paging 3 library
If the post has a picture, it can be viewed in full size and downloaded to device
